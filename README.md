# üåå STUDYFLOW

> A cool study tracker that actually keeps me motivated and tracks my progress.

## ‚ñ∏ So, What Is This?

I built **StudyFlow** to fix that. It's a clean, modern dashboard that makes tracking your study habits feel less like a chore and more like a game. It has a cool, glowing interface with a few different color themes to match your mood.

Best of all, it saves everything right in your browser. No sign-ups, no accounts. Just open the page and all your progress is there waiting for you.

## ‚ú® What It Can Do

*   **Track Your Sessions Live**: Just type in a subject, hit "Start," and the timer gets going.
*   **Set a Goal**: Use the simple slider to decide how long you want this study session to be.
*   **Quick Stats**: The main screen shows you all the important stuff at a glance‚Äîtotal time studied, number of sessions, and your top subject.
*   **A Calendar for Your Hard Work**: The calendar automatically puts a dot on days you studied. You can click any day to see a chart of what you worked on.
*   **Cool Charts to See Your Progress**: See how you've done over the last week with a simple bar chart, or check out the "More Charts" page for a donut chart that breaks down all your subjects.
*   **It Remembers You**: No need to worry about saving. Your data is automatically stored in your browser.

## üé® Pick Your Vibe

Staring at the same screen can get old. I added a few themes to help you switch things up.

*   `üü£ Purple Haze` - The classic cool and focused purple theme.
*   `üåê Cyber Glow` - A bright, futuristic-looking theme with lots of cyan.
*   `üî• Solar Flare` - A warm, high-energy orange theme for when you need a boost.

## üöÄ What It's Built With

I kept things simple and focused on the front-end. No complicated servers or anything like that.

*   **HTML5**
*   **CSS3** (I used variables to make the themes work!)
*   **JavaScript**
*   **Chart.js** (This library does all the heavy lifting for the cool charts)

## üôè Acknowledgments

A big thanks to Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro model, which helped me code, debug, and document this project. (Codespaces is awesome for this feature)

## ‚ö° How to Run It

This project is already set up to work perfectly in GitHub Codespaces.

1.  **Get the "Live Server" extension:** If you don't have it, go to the Extensions tab on the left and search for `Live Server` (the one by Ritwick Dey is great). Click install.
2.  **Launch it:** In the file explorer, find the `index.html` file, right-click on it, and choose **"Open with Live Server"**.
3.  **Check the pop-up:** A little notification will appear in the bottom-right corner. Just click **"Open in Browser"** and you're all set.
